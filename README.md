Evaluation of Extreme Resistance to Bacterial Wilt Diseases in Capsicum spp.

This repository contains the **R code** developed during my Master's research project:  
**"Extreme Resistance to Bacterial Wilt Diseases in *Capsicum* spp."**

The repository focuses on **data visualization and analysis**, including disease progression, clustering, and resistance screening in *Capsicum* germplasms.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
- The **variable names, cultivar names, and data files provided here are only examples for reference**.  
- They are **not real experimental data**.  
- Example datasets are included to demonstrate the required data structure for the code to run.

## Repository Structure

1. **Disease Progression (61 pepper germplasms, Ralstonia strain SL1931)**  
   - Line graphs with two different aesthetics for comparison and presenting.

2. **Clustering Analysis & Heat map**  
   - Dendrogram of cultivars based on resistance levels.  
   - Heatmap of disease severity distribution.  

3. **Stable Resistance Screening (Multiple *Ralstonia* strains)**  
   - Visualization of resistance across *Capsicum* spp. germplasms.

## Example Data

- Example CSV files are included to show **how the data should be organized** before running the scripts.  
- These files contain **dummy values only** for structural guidance.
